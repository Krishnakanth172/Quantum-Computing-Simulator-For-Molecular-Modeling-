This is a Quantum Computing Simulator for Molecular Modeling using PennyLane, Qiskit, and Python. This will model the molecular systems so that their
quantum states and interactions can be calculated through quantum simulation techniques. The application of quantum computing allows the simulator to obtain 
highly accurate calculations for molecular structures that are otherwise challenging when computed using classical methods.
Draw up the quantum circuit that would demonstrate a simulation for the given molecule system of quantum gate and its outcomes.
Write down the expression for the molecular Hamiltonian.

Quantum simulation: Run the implementation with both PennyLane and Qiskit programs in order to understand how quantized energy can be quantified throughout space
for the quantum states represented of the atoms in that particular molecule: it determines all the electronic distribution and hence further interaction as well that it goes on.

Dataset: A dataset of molecular data may be used which can be entered directly or retrieved from ChemBL or PubChem database. 
The molecules are written in Hamiltonian form for quantum simulations.
Examples: H2, LiH or larger organic molecules
Molecular data include atomic structure, bond length, and angle, all of which will be processed to give the Hamiltonian.

Model Architecture
The quantum simulation has
Quantum Circuit: quantum circuit simulation of the quantum system by the application of various quantum gates,
namely the Pauli-X gate and Pauli-Z gates; Hadamard and the CNOT gates. Application of Quantum Chemistry Algorithm that is used by Jordan Wigner
Transformation for generating Molecular Hamiltonian.
Quantum state evolution: the evolution of the quantum state of the given system as per the provided Hamiltonian.
Measurement: The final state of the quantum system is measured in order to calculate the probability of each possible molecular configuration.
